# Swagger Petstore API â€“ Store endpoints (assignment)

This project is a **partial documentation and analysis** of selected endpoints related to the `Store` entity within the [Swagger Petstore API](https://petstore.swagger.io/). It was developed as part of a **postgraduate coursework assignment** focused on practicing API documentation and exploration.

## Purpose

The main goal of this work is to:

- Practice reading and interpreting OpenAPI specifications.
- Explore and describe the functionality of store-related endpoints in the Swagger Petstore.
- Gain familiarity with API documentation tools and best practices.

## Scope

This is **not a complete or production-grade** project. It covers a **subset of the available endpoints**, with emphasis on demonstrating understanding rather than exhaustive documentation.

Endpoints covered include:

- `GET/store/inventory`
- `GET/store/order/{orderId}`
- `POST/store/order`
- `DELETE/store/order/{orderId}`

The analysis includes request/response examples, descriptions, and intended use cases.
